7,Wasting Vinegar on a Cucumber is a Shame!,"I first bought pickled asparagus at an Amish market and it was love at first bite. Hence, when I saw these on the discount rack at the local Safeway I cleaned it out.  These are even better than the ones from the Amish market. They are fantastic, and some of the jars have a bonus clove of garlic at the bottom. I'm going to order the six pack and I'm a household of one. They wont go to waste!","Great pickled asparagus at the local Safeway! Great price for you and you'll never go waste! I'm going to order the six pack and I'll be a household of one!

9,My Idea of a Good Diet Food.,"I'm presently on a diet and I was at my Fresh and Easy Neighborhood Grocery looking over possible diet foods. I wanted things that were tasty, non-fat and low in calories. I came home with about a dozen items. That's how I discovered the Tillen Farms Pickled Crispy Asparagus. Well, I've always liked asparagus anyway and I've enjoyed several brands of pickled asparagus. This Tillen Farms brand is really, really good! It's the best I can recall. There's an excellent flavor and a big clove of garlic down in  the bottom of the jar which I'm looking forward to eating. I can't believe how good this asparagus tastes and right on the front it says ""only 60 calories per jar!"" Now this is my idea of a good diet food!<br /><br />Gary Peterson",Tillen Farms Pickled Crispy Asparagus - YUMMY - 60 calories per jar! Good diet food for you and you can't go wrong - you'll love it! I like it - it's my idea of a good diet foods - yummy!
